#### What's next
I'll build auto buy and sell system using any BankingAPI and we'll see what's gonna happen :D

#### Why I built this?

Day to day, I'm controlling stocks and reading about them. Once I see www.isyatirim.com.tr/, I said if the suggestions in the website can make me profit.
Then instead of controlling the webpage everytime, built this application, which sends me a message whenever something is new (stock specific updates).
